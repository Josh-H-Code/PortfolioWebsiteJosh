                    <h2>1. Introduction </h2>
                    <p>This essay reflects on what went well and what could have been better in relation to the website
                        that I have built to showcase the three compositions in my portfolio. I used a couple of
                        applications to design and build the site and its contents. I used Figma to create the
                        overarching design and Bootstrap which gave me the template and made the site responsive.
                        The website showcased three compositions which I designed: a) "Wild Cat" - a low poly art cat
                        face graphic using a pattern art style b) "Crazy Stairs" - a 3D stair case effect using a
                        repetition art style and c) "Shattered Glass" - a shattered stain glass window using a pattern
                        art style.</p>
                    <h3>2. Reflection - Critical Evaluation</h3>


                    <h4>What went well </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- I quickly learnt and became comfortable with new applications such as Figma and Bootstrap.
                            I learnt that I should be more curious about what applications exist to enable my website to
                            be engaging.</li>
                        <li>- I was pleased with the 'JH' branding that I added to give the website a visual identity
                            linked to me. This is something that makes the site appear more professional. I could make
                            this even more impactful next time.</li>
                        <li>- The carousel with the compositions showcases them really well and keeps the user's
                            interest. I like the designs that I created as they are bright and colourful and have a good
                            impact.</li>
                        <li>- I also changed the style sheet from the standard one in the template to give my website
                            more uniqueness and personality.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>What could have gone better and how have I learnt from them</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- My planning could have been better. I found the fact that the html was on one file and the
                            CSS on another was confusing. I didn't give myself enough time at this stage of the planning
                            to work this through without stress. Going forward I would give myself more time at each
                            stage to avoid pressure.</li>
                        <li>- Although I was fairly happy with my compositions, I felt they could have been better if I
                            had been more visionary with my ideas. Next time I will seek inspiration from other areas
                            for my designs. So in this case I could have sought inspiration from modern art to push my
                            thinking further.</li>
                        <li>- I also used the same artistic style for two of my compositions - "Wild Cat" and "Shattered
                            Glass" were both pattern styles while "Crazy Stairs" was repetition. Next time I would use
                            other artistic styles such as radical or rhythmic to make this standout.</li>
                        <li>- Finally I would ask for some feedback from users to get some additional ideas for
                            improvement. This is something that is very important in website design to ensure the site
                            is easy to use for the end user.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h2>3. Summary</h2>

                    <p>In summary, I really enjoyed this project. It has given me the foundations in website design and
                        development. I am thinking about how I can use this learning to develop other websites. I will
                        reflect on the things that went well and the things that could have gone better to make my next
                        project even better.</p>
